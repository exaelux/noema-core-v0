# Noema — Examples

This directory contains **practical, minimal examples** illustrating how Noema Core can be applied to real-world scenarios while preserving privacy by design.

Each example represents a **single Noema semantic object**. The object itself does not change; what changes is **how it can be read and interpreted** depending on context, role, and authorization.

No example exposes sensitive or personal data.

## 1. Core Minimal — Semantic Core Only

**File:** `core-minimal.json`

This example represents the **absolute minimum Noema Core output**.

It confirms that a tokenized object exists and is readable on-chain, provides an opaque semantic meaning, and declares abstract visibility. No domain logic, evaluation, or sensitive data is included.

This demonstrates Noema’s **radical minimalism**: the core can function with only existence, meaning, and visibility, while remaining universally extensible.

## 2. Identity / Credential — Operational Proof

**File:** `identity-certificate.json`

This example shows how Noema interprets a **digital identity or credential** without exposing personal data.

The object is semantically understood as a certificate that is verified, valid, and usable as proof. Systems can rely on its operational meaning (e.g. access or eligibility) without learning anything about the holder’s identity details.

This illustrates how Noema supports **identity-based use cases with privacy by design**.

## 3. Asset / Supply Chain — Representational Semantics

**File:** `asset-supply-chain.json`

This example represents a **physical or digital asset** in a supply chain context.

The object is operational, valid, and usable as a representation of a good or batch, while external references provide traceability. No proprietary, commercial, or sensitive data is exposed.

It demonstrates how Noema can be applied beyond identity, enabling **semantic interoperability for assets and logistics** without leaking underlying data.

## 4. Health / Travel — Privacy-Preserving Compliance

**File:** `health-travel-exemption.json`

This example demonstrates how Noema can be used in **highly sensitive and regulated domains**, such as health and international travel.

The semantic reading confirms that a valid and usable certificate exists and can be used as proof for travel compliance. Crucially, no medical condition, diagnosis, or personal health data is revealed.

Public systems can verify **operational sufficiency**, while deeper interpretation is possible only through external authorization or legal mechanisms. This illustrates Noema’s **layered semantic model**, where privacy is preserved by default and meaning is revealed only when justified.

## Key Principle Illustrated

> **Noema does not reveal more data. It reveals more meaning — only when justified.**

This layered approach allows the same semantic object to support operability, privacy, and regulation simultaneously.

* All examples conform to the Noema Core v0.1 schema
* Reference Profile fields are optional and non-normative
* Implementations are free to define additional domain-specific profiles
