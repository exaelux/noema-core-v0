# Noema — Identity Profile (v0.1)

This document defines the **Identity Domain Profile** for Noema.

The profile provides a common semantic interpretation for identity-related objects such as credentials, attestations, and eligibility proofs, without modifying the Noema Core.

This profile is **non-normative** and optional.

---

## Scope

This profile applies to:

- Digital credentials
- Eligibility proofs
- Access-related attestations
- Identity-linked claims

It does **not** define:

- Identity standards (DID, VC, etc.)
- Legal identity
- Authentication or authorization logic
- Data storage or disclosure mechanisms

---

## Semantic Extensions

The Identity Profile interprets the `meaning` field of a Noema Core object using the following semantic concepts:

- `credential_type`
- `subject_role`
- `eligibility_status`
- `intended_use`

These fields are **interpretive**, not mandatory.

---

## Privacy Model

- No personal data is required
- No identifiers are exposed
- Only operational meaning is expressed
- Deeper interpretation requires external authorization

---

## Relationship to Noema Core

- The Core remains unchanged
- This profile exists entirely within `meaning`
- Compliance with the Core schema is mandatory
- Compliance with this profile is optional
