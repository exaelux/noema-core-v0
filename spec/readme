# Noema — Technical Specification (v0.1)

This directory contains the **technical specification** of Noema Core.

The specification defines the semantic invariants, design constraints, and non-goals that any Noema-compliant implementation must respect. It focuses on **what Noema means**, not on how it is implemented.

The scope is intentionally minimal to preserve neutrality, extensibility, and long-term stability.

## Scope of the Specification

This specification covers:

- The definition of a *Noema Semantic Object*
- The strict separation between **existence**, **meaning**, and **content**
- The guarantees provided by the Noema Core
- The boundaries between the Core, Reference Profiles, and external systems

This specification explicitly does **not** define:

- Execution logic or workflows
- Permission or access-control systems
- Consent management mechanisms
- Legal enforcement or regulatory interpretation
- Domain-specific ontologies or business logic

## Normative vs Non-Normative Components

The Noema ecosystem distinguishes clearly between **normative** and **non-normative** elements.

### Normative

The following components are considered normative for Noema v0.1:

- The Noema Core semantic model
- The definition of a Noema Semantic Object
- The guarantees of neutrality, minimalism, and determinism
- The Core output structure as formalized in `/schemas`

Any compliant implementation must preserve these properties.

### Non-Normative

The following components are explicitly non-normative:

- Reference Semantic Profiles
- Example objects and use cases
- Domain-specific interpretations
- Tooling, validation scripts, or SDKs

These components may evolve or be replaced without affecting Core compliance.

## Semantic Guarantees

Noema Core provides the following guarantees:

- **Neutrality**: semantic readings describe states, never judgments
- **Minimalism**: only the minimum semantic information required for operability is exposed
- **Determinism**: identical
